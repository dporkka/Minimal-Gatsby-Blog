<p><strong>Recent Adventures</strong></p>

<p>This month, my family took a road trip out to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badlands_National_Park">Badlands National Park</a> in South Dakota and did some hiking. If you haven't seen the Badlands before you should check them out. I would describe them as a magestic maze of colorful, dried-up, ancient seabeds that are surrounded by grass prairies, buttes, and mountainous spires. It was odd hiking in them, because I felt like I was simultaneously hiking a mountain and seabed. After a few days of hiking the steep inclines on these seabeds and through rattlesnake-filled trails, we then got back in the car and drove to Colorado to see my brother and do some more hiking in Estes Park.</p>

<p>Estes Park is a true hikers paradise—it has all the trails you could ever hike and more. Being in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountain_National_Park">Rocky Mountain National Park</a>, you might think they're just a bunch of rocky, mountain trails, but you would be greatly mistaken. Estes park is very diverse and has everything from mountain lakebeds and waterfalls, to grassy slopes with marmot caves, and 14,000 foot climbs that some people use hiking poles, wear helmets, and spiked mountain boots for. Unlike the pro mountaineers, I was just wearing some running shoes, but I definately should have been wearing some hiking shoes on some parts of the trail. The only thing that I didn&rsquo;t like about that trip was the 14-hour ride on the way back to Wisconsin that started in the afternoon and went through the night.</p>

<p><strong>New Routines&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The scrawny to brawny transformation is underway. I&rsquo;ve also been doing a lot of pull-ups, using TRX straps to do ab work and cardio, lifting weights to build some muscle, and jump roping to prepare for my next fight.</p>
<p>Just kidding, I don't plan on fighting anytime soon, and it was the first time I picked up a jump rope after about 7-10 years. I was really surprised by the workout I had and my feet were still sore the next few days! I also started to run again after not running for a few months. My current running strategy is to run at like 80% effort until I'm tired, then walk for a minute or two, and repeat, usually in quarter-mile increments. I&rsquo;m slowly starting to build my stamina again to run more than a quarter-mile at a time.&nbsp; I'll report later on the effectiveness of this strategy.</p>

<p><strong>Current Music</strong></p>

<p>Love the funky upbeat groove these guys have. Their other songs are just as good as the ones above and you should check out their latest album <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4TFD2PfVPw">Live Volume 1</a></i>. If you like Jefferson Airplane or The Alan Parsons Project, you&rsquo;ll probably like Parcels.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8fmOciEY8U">Technicolor Beat &mdash; Oh Wonder</a></p>

<p>Overlapping male and female vocals, complex choreography of various background sounds that blend in an ear-soothing, technicolor beat.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAxcxUOZcDU">The Journey&nbsp; &mdash; Tom Misch</a></p>

<p>Tom Misch's songs are very diverse, but this one is down-tempo, instrumental, contemplative, and representative of the south London jazz scene, which I just starting to appreciate after my brother introduced me to it. I'll add more English jazz songs soon.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaBYoEjEo2M">A Scent of Lily &ndash; Augustine&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve listened to this song a lot this month and still can&rsquo;t relate to the lyrics, but love the vocal range of the singer and the constantly changing pitch which builds nicely with melody. Listen to the first minute of it before you decide it&rsquo;s not for you.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>TV Shows</strong></p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t been watching much TV lately, but I finished season 4 of <em>Money Heist</em>, which is a show about two elaboratively planned, action-packed, nerve-racking bank heists in Spain. I started watching this show mostly to improve my Spanish, but continued to watch because it was sooo good. Every scene in this show is masterfully crafted and the acting is some of the best I&rsquo;ve seen. I can&rsquo;t wait for the final season to be released.</p>
<p>Another addicting show that I&rsquo;ve been catching up on is the futuristic, sci-fi show, <em>Altered Carbon</em>, where people can transfer their consciousness into another body via &ldquo;stacks&rdquo; in their neck and live forever, or at least until someone destroys their stack. I&rsquo;ve watched a lot of sci-fi over the years and I would rate this show 10/10.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Movies </strong>(spoiler alert orange)</p>

<p>The Other Guys &mdash; I loved the unconventional beginning of this movie, having the main protagonists randomly die, by jumping off a building and landing on the concrete below. I had to watch that scene again, since it was so unexpected and funny. Besides the intro, this movie was loaded with funny one-liners, situational humor, and plot twists. I think it&rsquo;s worth a watch and would rate it 8.5/10.</p>

<p><strong>Current Beverages</strong></p>

<p>Kick Ass (actual name) dark roast coffee by kicking horse. Despite my primitive way of preparing it, by tossing the grounds in a tea filter and letting it steep, this coffee is some of the best I&rsquo;ve had. Will repeat bi-daily.</p>
