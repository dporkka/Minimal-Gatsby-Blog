You don't have to be the first to be valuable. Putting a new spin on an existing idea, or being someone who shares things that helpful, useful, or interesting; is worthwhile.

Reinventing the wheel isn't a waste of time if you come up with a slightly different wheel or come up with a new spin on an existing idea. Everything is spinning and being recycled, from the galaxies, to the planets, to the atoms. 

Nothing is completely original anymore and all the physics that will probably ever exist, exist now. It's up to us to spin up new things with the existing parts or use the existing parts to spin things to do something useful.
