After World War 2, the Amer-Italian relationship was strained. Many Americans still saw the Italians as war enemies and American grocery stores wouldn't sell to them. So the Italians who lived in the U.S. had no other choice than to work in soup kitchens to stay alive. Despite their hatred for the Italian soup cooks, the Americans soon learned they could cook better soup than many of the fancier restaurants in town. And before long, more people were lining up for the soup kitchens than the gourmet restaurants.

Angry and confused, the restaurant owners started to investigate how the poorly stocked soup kitchens could compete with their world-class chefs. So, they sent their best chefs disguised as homeless people to the soup kitchens to figure out their secret noodle recipe. But after countless tasting, the recipe remained a mystery.

The chefs soon realized their only chance to reverse engineer the linguini was by sneaking it out and bringing it to a food chemist. But there was a problem---the soup kitchen noodles were huge and wet. Even if you could get one in your pockets, the wet mark and noodle bulge would be clear signs of a heist. And the Italians noticed everything, eventually kicking out all the chefs who tried to steal their precious linguini.

After failing to sneak out the recipe as homeless people, their next noodle extraction attempt involved just being themselves ---greased hair, tuxedo's, cigars, and all. They attempted to bribe the Italians, offering fine cutlery and wealth beyond imagination to any Italian who would disclose the sacred recipe. But the Italians knew that the recipe was worth more than even the finest gold. It was a family secret passed down for generations, offering more pleasure and happiness than any other material good could offer.

Finally, the restaurants grew frustrated with their inability to obtain the linguini recipe, so they resorted to what they knew best---brute force, by hiring local gangsters to rough up the Italians, into sharing their recipe. The Italians weren't your typical push-overs, who would give up their heritage recipe after a few knife fights, though. They were either in their own gangs or were war veterans. And unlike the New York gangsters, who depended on thin, unfortified ramen noodles, the Italians were well-fed on carbohydrate-rich linguini that enabled them to fight for days without returning to the kitchens.

The Italian gangster cooks were also much better trained than their American counterparts. They had been kneading dough for generations and dealing with the hardships of the New York winters with little shelter or sleep; while many of the American gangsters lived cushy lives and only resorted to gang life on the weekends. Before long, it was clear the Americans stood no chance, so they decided to offer a truce---the linguini recipe, for the end of the war. But the Italians didn't mind the war as much as their lack of freedom to cook. So they ripped up the treaty and mailed a piece of it to all the restaurants who had ties to the gangsters. 

This further upset the restaurant owners and led them to hold a great banquet with all the best minds and muscles in the restaurant business in order to solve the linguini dilemma. Eventually, it was decided that they needed the help of the Chicago gangster chefs to obtain the recipe. 

The Chicago gangsters understood the value of a good recipe. It wasn't long ago that they were inspired by the Italians to make the deep dish pizza, which allowed the Chicagoans to survive the harsh midwest winters and become one of the most populated cities in the world. Fueled by deep-dish pizzas, the Chicago gangsters could also fight longer and harder than the New York gangsters, but they were still weak compared to the linguini-powered Italians. Yet with the combined strength of the New Yorkers and the Chicagoans, the Italians were finally starting to feel the pressure to give up their recipe. 

To fend off against the increased gang attacks, the Italian soup kitchens worked overtime to supply the needed calories to fight the two-front war. At first, this strategy was successful, but they were slowly starting to run out of noodles, and fending off both gangs from each side of the kitchen took a lot of calories. Eventually, the Italians realized their linguini supply was insufficient to keep fighting the war, so they offered a peace treaty. They would disclose the linguini recipe if they could cook in the American kitchens.

Most of the New York gangsters didn't agree to the treaty, but their Chicago allies forced their hand to sign it, resulting in a temporary peace amongst the gangster cooks. This peace was later made permanent after a few more months of cook-offs and Michelin battles between the Italians and New Yorkers, which led to the Italians proving their worth in the kitchens and America at large, to both to the New York chefs and the general public.

Many Italians eventually opened their own restaurants which served the freshest linguini in all the States, the Chicagoans developed a thicker noodle style which was a good alternative to their pizzas, and the New Yorkers finally learned how to cook linguini, and in return, protected the Italians from other gangs who tried to obtain the recipe.
