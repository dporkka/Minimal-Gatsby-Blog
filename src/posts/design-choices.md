### **Frontpage Feed**

The front page of many blogs is focused more on new users than repeat users, by having a static about page. I understand the value of informing people who you are, but get bored seeing the same front page of my favorite blogs. So I built a feed-style front page that allows people to quickly see what’s new, without visiting all my pages. And people who are new can easily understand what I do, by seeing what I’m working on, without learning about me first and potentially building a bias.

### **Function > Branding**  

I chose to prioritize my pages by having most of my main navigation easily clickable, without hiding it behind a burger menu.

Instead of having my name take up all the space on the top of the screen for all my pages, I chose to just use my initials. Most people will probably realize davidporkka.com belongs to David Porkka, or see the footer credit at the bottom.

### **Minimalist > Creative**

Sometimes the best designs are invisible. They purposely get out of the way, so users can focus on the content and not the design. I want my users to appreciate my content more than my creativity.

### **Bottom-Border > Underlining Links**

Multiple accessibility studies have shown that underlined words can be hard to read, especially for non-native readers. By adding a bottom border under text instead of the default underlined text, my links are more readable, and in my opinion, look better.

### **Short Page Names**

By using “Bio” over “About”, “Email” over “Contact”, and “DP” instead of “David Porkka”, I was able to fit my most common navigation links on mobile screens without a burger menu.

### **Meaningful Colors and Shapes**

Blue colored text is associated with links, so I used blue text for all my links, except my navigation links, which I used a bottom border for, to make sure people knew they were links.

### **Simple Interactions > Complex**

Javascript can be completely disabled on my site and it would look and function about the same. I wanted to make things as simple and future-proof as possible, by limiting unnecessary javascript interactions. Plus, it makes things faster.

### **Top and Bottom Navigation Menus**

Instead of having a sticky header or footer that takes up space and distracts users, I opted instead to add page navigation to both the top and bottom of each page, so users can easily scroll up or down to navigate to a different page.
