### **Front Page Feed**

The front page of many blogs is focused more on new users than repeat users, by having a static "About" page. In my opinion, it's boring seeing the same front page on blogs when you revisit them. So this template features a feed-style front page that allows people to quickly see what’s new, without visiting all the pages. And people who are new, can easily understand what this site's about, by seeing the latest things you're working on.

### **Function > Branding**  

By using “Bio” over “About”, “Email” over “Contact”, and “DP” instead of “David Porkka”, the most common navigation links are able to fit on mobile screens without a burger menu. Most people will probably realize the owner of the site, by the footer credit at the bottom and the URL. 

### **Minimalist > Creative**

Sometimes the best designs are invisible. They purposely get out of the way, so users can focus on the content and not the design. Since this site is a blog and not an art gallery, the focus was on improving the reading experience. 

### **Bottom-Border > Underlining Links**

Multiple accessibility studies have shown that underlined words can be hard to read, especially for non-native readers. By adding a bottom border under text instead of the default underlined text, my links are more readable, and in my opinion, look better.

### **Meaningful Colors and Shapes**

Blue colored text is associated with links, so I used blue text for all my links, except my navigation links, which I used a bottom border for, to make sure people knew they were links.

### **Simple Interactions > Complex**

Javascript can be completely disabled on my site and it would look and function about the same. I wanted to make things as simple and future-proof as possible, by limiting unnecessary javascript interactions. Plus, it makes things faster.

### **Top and Bottom Navigation Menus**

Instead of having a sticky header or footer that takes up space and distracts users, I opted instead to add page navigation to both the top and bottom of each page, so users can easily scroll up or down to navigate to a different page.
